<p>I've got no experience with knex, which (I feel) we should welcome on this site, but I'm not going to be able to answer any of the questions about that, so would like to be able to filter them out using the ""Ignored Tags"" feature.</p>

<p>The opposite is probably equally likely: There may well be people who are experts in knex, but with limited interest in LEGO - shouldn't they also be allowed to ""Ignore"" LEGO specific questions?</p>

<p>Finally, thinking far into a possible future - look at <a href=""http://facebook.stackoverflow.com/"">Facebook.stackoverflow.com</a> if this site gets big enough that we become an ""official"" support channel for one of these toys, then providing this sort of separation is much harder if a specific toy isn't tagged correctly (we should aim high after all ;))</p>

<p><strong>Edit to add:</strong></p>

<p>I believe the relevant section of the guidelines is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The LEGO Trademarks may be used under certain Limited Circumstances on an Unofficial Web Site</strong><br />
  The LEGO trademarks (but not the logo) may be used in a non-commercial manner to refer to LEGO products or elements which are shown or discussed on a web site, as long as the trademark is not unduly emphasized or used in a way that can lead an observer to mistakenly believe that the site is sponsored or authorized by the LEGO Group.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Proper Use of the LEGO Trademark on a Web Site</strong><br />
  If the LEGO trademark is used at all, it should always be used as an adjective, not as a noun. For example, say ""MODELS BUILT OF LEGO BRICKS"". Never say ""MODELS BUILT OF LEGOs"".Also, the trademark should appear in the same typeface as the surrounding text and should not be isolated or set apart from the surrounding text. In other words, the trademarks should not be emphasized or highlighted. Finally, the LEGO trademark should always appear with a ® symbol each time it is used.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm not a lawyer, so can't really summarise it, however in the previous discussion, it was pointed out that we can't really police the community in terms of ""using the LEGO trademark as an adjective rather than a noun"", however where it is used on core parts of the site (FAQ, tags, etc.) then it should be as an adjective, and include the &reg; symbol.</p>

42,2,2011-10-26T17:23:27.767,18,,"<p>I think we should aim to cover three basic things:</p>

<p><strong>LEGO Bricks.</strong> Fundamentally, this toy dominates the building space. If we don't have this, we don't really have a site.</p>

<p><strong>LEGO Not-Bricks.</strong> Mindstorms, DUPLO, games, LEGOLand, Bionicle, Modulex, tables, carrying cases, alarm clocks, minifigure collections, company history, BrickMaster and MBA, Znap. The overlap is enormous between people interested in these and the bricks themselves and it's hard to separate them - is a question about a model at LEGOLand a question about bricks, or a question about LEGOLand?</p>

<p>It's also important to cover this so the site can serve as a resource for parents (and whether we want it to or not, it probably will this Christmas).</p>

<p><strong>Other Bricks.</strong> Diablock, Mega Blok, Nanoblock, and undoubtedly a new system every few years. Compatible or not, all brick toys share similar building techniques. In some cases, like Diablock, they are ""not compatible"" as stock pieces but people have built adapters.</p>

<p>That means we <em>don't</em> cover K'nex (perhaps shared interest but no shared building techniques), Meccano (in my experience, very little shared interest), and other progressively more marginal building systems. Otherwise I fear we'll see a gradual descent until we cover things that are barely even building toys like Domino Rally, and eventually just be a generic toy site.</p>

<p>You might say ""I'm as uninterested in alarm clocks and Znap as I am in K'nex!"" The good news is, the rest of the world agrees with you - the potential number of questions about these things is <em>very small</em> and can never come to dominate the site. That is not true of K'nex.</p>

<p>Why is it bad to offer more? Focus. If the site is 90% Lego, we're not going to attract K'nex or Meccano experts. If the site is 30% Lego, we're not going to attract Lego experts. <em>We need experts to survive.</em> Otherwise people will just go back to the existing Lego forums and wikis, because their questions can be answered just as poorly there.</p>

Since SE doesn't have such a thing as a signature block, I think it might be worth while to establish, early in our coming-out process, our community's relevant tolerance for people pushing either their commercial or non-commercial sites.</p>

<p>It feels to me like this has probably been hashed out somewhere else, but what counts is what we want in our community.  I know, for example, Joel S. recently talked about this on a recent SE podcast.</p>

<p>I personally feel that ""<strong>casual links are ok, but don't be annoying about it</strong>"" is a good-enough guideline.</p>

<p>There is a tension, in that we obviously don't want the site to be spammy, but also, we don't want to exclude the people that are literally professionals, either.  The people that are expert enough to have their own site will <em>always</em> have a need or desire to associate their awesome answer back to their site.  If they can't link back, then they are driving traffic away from their own site towards bricks.stackexchange.com.  We don't people to have make that choice.</p>

<p>Here is a concrete example:</p>

<p>I recently asked this: <a href=""https://bricks.stackexchange.com/questions/333/lego-safety-known-risks-and-how-to-avoid-them"">LEGO Safety: Known risks and how to avoid them?</a> I had already started writing a blog post on my website (<a href=""http://www.ascendly.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ascendly.com</a>) on this topic and wanted to take advantage of bricks.se.com to make my post even better.  It is my intention to link to the SE question in my post, and add link in my question back to my post.  How would you react to such a link?</p>

<p>The problem I see is one of scope. A Mindstorms charging station and the pivot-arm suspension (given the wheel sizes as specified in the question) are concrete goals with specific restrictions. ""A bridge with basic bricks"" is a vast universe of possible designs. How long? How much weight must it support? Beam or cantilever or arch? Even your question varies in whether you allow plates or not.</p>

I am a little unsure as to how well the strict question rules transfer over to this site, however.  Typically, questions that do not have concrete answers or are opinion-based are discouraged, as are requests for listing of resources.  I don't think that this level of stringency is appropriate for this site.  An example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is the best tool for computing gene-level expression?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This might immediately be flagged for deletion because it is both a resource request and opinion based, but keep in mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>It can be difficult to find scientific tools, especially if the analysis or function they perform is not very common or new.</li>
<li>While people might have opinions on what tool is the best, there are quantifiable ways of demonstrating that some scientific tools are better or worse, which can be important to capture an upvote for future reference.</li>
<li>There are a lot of unknowns in science, and therefore a lot of opinions, so one could argue a lot of things as opinion-based.  Therefore, some leniency should be expected in question asking.</li>

<p>For example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>How to correlate of two zero inflated bedgraph-like signals?</strong></p>
  
  <p>I have iCLIP read counts accross the transcriptome and I wish to know
  if the signals are correlated - that is, where one of them is high, is
  the other likely to be high. </p>
  
  <p>Often when dealing with such data (e.g. iCLIP data) we know that the
  data is generally sparse - that is at most positions both signals are
  zero and this is correct, and also zero-inflated - that is many bases
  that ""should"" have a signal are missing that data. So just calucalting the spearmans correlation is likely to give an artifically low value.</p>
  
  <p>These problems are also present if you want to correlate ChIP-seq
  signals or Mutation frequencies.</p>

<p>Anyway, my question is: <em>Should I just post questions like this, where I am unsure, and see if people think it is good. Or should I ask for everyone on Meta to see if people think its good?</em></p>

9,2,2017-05-17T14:34:31.530,3,,"<p>I have a proposal - tool questions/answers should be limited to discussions of pros/cons for a particular tool or tools. In other words, the question you posed (and bouncing off of <a href=""https://bioinformatics.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3/8"">Llopis' answer</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What are the pros/cons of computing gene level expression with A vs B?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This approach has a number of benefits:</p>

<ol>
<li>Answers to this question can be more objective. People may still quibble about whether a particular approach is better or worse, but the upsides/downsides of any approach shouldn't generate as much disagreement</li>
<li>This is probably a better way to think about such questions anyway, and answers to such questions are more generalizable to different experiments/approaches. In other words, even if a questioner asks about a particular experimental setup, good answers about the pros/cons of a particular tool will likely apply to other experimental setups.</li>
<li>These answers are less likely to go out of date, since new software will not change the pros/cons of particular approaches, but might change what the best approach is. And even old questions about out of date software will retain value for learners (since they will contain expert thought about how to assess the value of an approach).</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm not sure if this approach is applicable to all questions of this type, but it could certainly be applied to most. It will take more effort from questioners, since they will have to do some research to actually bring up a tool or tools, but this will probably make for better questions anyway, and there's no reason an answer couldn't bring up some new tool that wasn't asked.</p>

29,2,2017-05-19T12:28:43.587,8,,"<p>Here's my take on each of the points you raise:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Unfriendly community, questions are received with down-votes</strong></p>

<p>I know many people feel this way but my experience in the SE network has been the exact opposite. Downvotes are not bad. Let me repeat that. <strong><em>Downvotes are not bad</em></strong>. They are in fact precisely what makes the SE sites so useful. We <em>need</em> bad posts to be downvoted, that's the only way good posts come to the top. yes, some people can take the downvotes as an insult instead of as an invitation to improve their answer. Quite simply, those people won't have a good time here so it would be better for them—and us—if they go to another site.That's not a problem, there's enough to go around. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Toxic environment</strong></p>

<p>That <em>really</em> isn't my impression of SE and I feel that most people who feel it's toxic simply don't understand the system and consider downvotes and closed questions to be personal attacks. With the possible exception of SO which is orders of magnitude larger than any other site, most SE sites are relatively friendly as long as you put some effort into your posts. Yes, dumping your homework with no attempt to solve it and asking others to do your work for you are not well received. Well, they shouldn't be. </p>

<p>However, I have been quite active (>10 or 20k rep) on 4 sites of the network, I'm an elected mod on two and participate in quite a few more. I haven't felt any of them were in any way ""toxic"". Maybe I was lucky, granted, but I really think the ""toxicity"" is almost entirely born of simple misunderstandings about what the SE site are and are not. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of support from moderators</strong></p>

<p>I don't really know what that is supposed to mean. I see some complaints about too much moderation in the linked biostars post but none of a lack thereof. Also, most people who're not familiar with SE tend to assume that anyone who cotes to close a post or edits or does anything else that wouldn't be possible by users on traditional forums is a mod. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of discussion about questions</strong></p>

<p>Yes, absolutely! SE is not a forum and not the right place for disussion. But that's great! If you need a discussion, you can always go to Biostars or SeqAnswers or even our <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/58858/bioinformatics"">chat</a>. This isn't a place for discussion, it's a Q&amp;A site. That's fine: to each their own.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Adding more sites is diluting the user base</strong></p>

<p>Dunno about that. I, for example, find both SeqAnswers and Biostars unpleasant, chaotic and far harder to extract useful information out of than the SE sites. Which is why I am so pleased with this proposal. So it's not so much a question of diluting the community as it is one of offering multiple venues where each of us can find their niche and the site they find most useful. There are enough bioinformaticians around by now that the community can support multiple sites, I think. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cross-post with other communities</strong></p>

<p>Why does this matter? If another community has a useful piece of information, we copy it over. That's the beauty of open licenses. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>License of the code provided in Stack Exchange</strong></p>

<p>Again, for me that's a feature and not a bug. Any code posted here can be used by anyone else in the community with attribution. Surely that's a good thing?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In summary, there's no reason to please everyone. This is an SE site and the SE network has clearly demonstrated that there are many, many users who enjoy their system and find it useful in their work. Other people find it too restrictive or negative or hard to deal with. That's absolutely fine. Those of us who like the SE system are free to use this site and those of us who don't are free to use the others. Nobody is forcing anyone to do anything. </p>

<p>So yes, we should be friendly and open and helpful to newbies. Ignorance is never a sin. On the other hand, laziness and unwillingness to put effort into your question and answer are, and I see no reason why we shouldn't have strict quality standards. Many SE sites cater to both experts and novices and the level of expertise is far less important than the effort put into a post. So as long as you don't use this site as a substitute for doing your own work, you should be welcome to ask a question of any level of expertise here. But not things that would be answered by pasting the question title into Google or Wikipedia. Some effort is required, yes.</p>

<p>Something like that can be answered by citing a specific review paper and the measurements there. In any case, the ""best"" usually depends on what you're doing.

While it may look like bioinformatics, it is very hard to interpret such alignments usefully without some basic knowledge about the biological concepts of sequence evolution, the chemical properties of amino acids, protein domains, exons, introns etc. So a good answer would have to include at least some ""pure"" biology.</p>

37,1,2017-05-22T11:23:18.727,6,64,"<p>One of the first things I needed to learn when coming to SO for the first time was how to ask a good question. I suspect I'm not alone in this. I was fortunate to have responses to my first (poorly asked) questions that: </p>

<ol>
<li>Explained why asking the question well was important</li>
<li>Explained the steps I could take to improve my question</li>
</ol>

<p>And they did so in an insistent but friendly way. This positive reinforcement (combined with the requirement that I do more work) allowed me to learn how to ask better questions without getting discouraged. I often think that the bad reputation that SO has among many people is that their first experience(s) asking questions were treated rudely or just downvoted with no explanation.</p>

<p>So I'm wondering if we should have some standard language people can use for some common question faux pas. I was prompted to ask by <a href=""https://bioinformatics.stackexchange.com/users/191/iakov-davydov"">Iakov Davydov</a>'s response to <a href=""https://bioinformatics.stackexchange.com/questions/162/anion-silica-membrane-matrix-compositions"">this question</a>, which I think is a good start. Friendly but clear on what additional steps should be taken.</p>

<p>So the actual question: should we have a bank of standard responses? This might increase the chances that (a) people will comment to explain to people how questions can be improved and that (b) those responses will be welcoming to new users while training them to ask better questions.</p>

That number is not arbitrary &mdash; it's the minimum bar of activity we've needed for a site to remain viable in the 180+ sites we've launch. And that's a bare <em>minimum.</em></p>

<p><strong>You have less than <em>half</em> that.</strong></p>

<p>Fair warning: Simply having the same people ask more questions is not sustainable and not a solution for giving the <em>appearance</em> of organic growth. You need more users. </p>

<h2>What can you do to help?</h2>

<p><strong>We've got a week, so nobody is writing this site off.</strong> I just wanted to give you this heads up in case there's a group of users waiting in the wings for this site to go public.

41,2,2017-05-30T20:43:08.983,9,,"<p>I think this is a little bit the wrong question, it should be ""Is there a large enough community to support two almost identical sites."" The core of the problem is that there is a community already on biostars and in principle all the users you want are already here: <a href=""https://www.biostars.org/user/list/?sort=reputation&amp;limit=all%20time&amp;q="" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.biostars.org/user/list/?sort=reputation&amp;limit=all%20time&amp;q=</a></p>

<p>Some have predicted that this beta might not work, simply because there is already this established site, and I mostly agree with them. Bioinformatics is a scientific field with a growing but limited audience compared to other topics like programming. In my opinion, it is unlikely that there exists a large potential scientific community that is so far put off by the technical limitations and other shortcomings that surely BioStars.org has, and that is also able and willing to invest time into QA. In other words, the people who are available are most likely already engaged, and for most of the other scientist the tiny differences are marginal compared to large scientific problems of interest.      </p>

<p>To make people transition to the SE brand, you needed to offer them some added value. Indeed the SE technology is superior, but that is not good enough. Certainly BioStars has a superior user base from interested beginner to PhD students to senior researchers and professors, with enthusiasm and experience in Q&amp;A. That knowledge base will certainly attract more questions because there is a much better chance to get a competent answer. Just to add some figures, on biostars, there were >300 posts this week, and >60 today, from a total of 35,000 users.</p>

<p>What is more, as it turns out, one cannot take over the reputation from the other site, thus I have decided that I am not available for doing much on bioinformatics.SE, because why start out as a rookie here again? </p>

<p>Small communities have merits.

<p><strong>Then make the site public.</strong></p>

<p>It’s as simple as that.</p>

<p>Unlike other Beta SE sites, there are already large, competing Bioinformatics Q&amp;A sites on the internet<sup>1</sup>, so unlike for other sites people won’t go out of their way to subscribe to a private site here. There’s simply not enough demand.</p>

<p>Now, I’ll be the first to say that the competing Q&amp;A sites are <em>very</em> unsatisfactory for various reasons. But they exist, and they represent large parts of the professional bioinformatics community. A private Bioinf.SE isn’t an attractive competition. In order to <em>become</em> attractive it has to offer <em>more</em> than the competition, not less. This means: open the site, and implement <a href=""https://bioinformatics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/feature-request"">crucial, missing usability features</a>.</p>

<p>Robert, you’ve been in this business a while, you know how communities work. So I’m honestly surprised that this comes as a shock to anybody at Stack Exchange.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that Stack Exchange should have a vested commercial interest in successful communities. And while I appreciate the extent to which commercial interests have taken a backseat to community building at Stack Exchange, maybe it’s worth considering the pros of giving some support to a Bioinformatics.SE community.</p>

47,1,2017-06-01T13:48:16.410,14,206,"<p>I have been thinking about this for a while. <a href=""https://bioinformatics.stackexchange.com/questions/327/qc-measures-for-ngs-sequencing"">This recently on-hold question</a> really touches my nerve. The question is put on hold due to being too ""broad"". I will use it as an example to explain my concerns.</p>

<p>First, ""broad"" (as well as ""off-topic"" etc) is subjective. In this particular case, I think the question is on the border line at best. I certainly would not vote to close it, even though I am actually quite picky. To most new NGS users, they would think this is a fine question, too.</p>

<p>Second, even if ""broad"", this question is interesting and useful. It has attracted 4 upvotes in 13 hours, which is relatively fast in this new SE. The answer tells me something new and equally interesting. It has got 5 upvotes, too.</p>

<p>Third, broad questions may inspire epic answers. For this question, someone familiar with QC might take the chance to give a succinct but comprehensive review of existing QC tools and measurements, something you occasionally see at SO or other SE sites. This would be invaluable to everyone. You can't get such an answer from a specific question on a particular technical problem with a QC tool.</p>

<p>Fourth, at this particular time we are struggling to pass the private beta phase, I speculate that closed questions are not counted. @RobertCartaino said we had less than 75 questions a couple of days ago. However, as @gringer pointed out, we had 77 questions almost at the same time. In addition, on the <a href=""https://bioinformatics.stackexchange.com/questions"">question page</a>, we have 102 questions right now, but on the <a href=""http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/109245/bioinformatics"">Area51 page</a>, we only have (15+1)*4.9=78.4 questions. Why the difference?</p>

<p>Finally, even if not just for private beta, we need both experts AND new users to keep this site alive. To me, the questions here are a little too ""narrow"". They focus too much on specific technical issues. Questions slightly deviating from this focus quickly got downvoted or closed. Note that we are competing with BioStar. Although criticized for all the problems, its broadness and friendliness to newcomers are undeniable. If we keep closing border-line questions so aggressively, we would push new users to biostar and finally kill this SE, again.</p>

<p>So, please refrain from closing proper but imperfect questions so quickly.</p>

<p>One reason to have some of these more general questions is to provide potential canonical answers to future questions from many newcomers.  Another reason is it provides a base of general knowledge over time.  Anyone who has spent time on sister sites like Stack Overflow can see how over time, questions become more and more specific as the general cases gain answers that are widely accepted by the community.</p>

<p>Note that I'm <em>not</em> talking about questions that are too generic or opinion-based and thus off-topic, e.g. ""Is beer good for you?"" or ""What is the best kind of beer?"", or filling the site with junk questions just to make it appear active.  </p>

<ul>
<li>Here is an StackExchange site that focus on a <em>specific</em> topic. If the site was based on <strong><em>all</strong> alcohol drinks</em> or <strong><em>all</strong> drinks</em>, then more specific questions might be expected. But here is about beer, and all <em>answerable</em> questions must be on topic. When the community grows larger and attracts too many people and <em>too many</em> low quality questions starts to disturb community, then it might be discussed again.</li>
<li>Attracting experts is a good thing to have. But no StackExchange site must be a place for <em>just</em> experts. Good question is the question which is <em>clear</em> and <em>answerable</em>. We need a good content now. </li>
<li>Experts will look for good sites that have a vast variety of content that they interested in. Forums do not have this since they are like trash. Even they have some good content, the rest of the content show it rubbish-ish. We must make questions be good and answerable and keep answers clean and understandable by many other users (not only ones who asks and answer). In short, Q&amp;A format must also offers future reference for other community members and people outside this community (unregistered users.)</li>
<li>Enthusiasts or beginners asks general and simple questions. Mostly, people who have enough knowledge may produce such specific and attractive questions. By having a good Q&amp;A base of basic and non-specific questions, community will create users who have enough knowledge to ask better questions.</li>

48,2,2014-01-27T15:23:40.737,4,,"<p>This has been answered in a couple of places, namely in a comment, but I'll go ahead and give it a go.</p>

<p><strong>Mission</strong> </p>

<p>Homebrew has a pretty specific mission and vision. To support home brewers in the brewing of their own beer. To do that they do take on a variety of topics around the beer industry, tasting, ingredients etc.</p>

<p>However, the scope of this site is broader and more expansive. It includes large scale production, excludes super small scale production and generally is more focused on the <em>consumption</em> of beer rather than production.</p>

<p><strong>Audience</strong></p>

<p>This is where the real differences lie. While there is likely <em>a good bit</em> of audience overlap (probably all homebrewers are beer drinkers), Home brewers are a <em>subset</em> of all beer drinkers. This site is intended to appeal to the superset of beer drinkers.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>The only real issue here is the ordering of the site's beginnings. Typically how site parentage would work would be that the larger audience site would be the first, and then the separate interest group would splinter. In this case the separate interest group already has their own site with their own question set.</p>

<p>There are a couple of interesting questions here on meta that address this further: </p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""https://alcohol.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1/is-homebrewing-on-topic"">Is Homebrewing on topic?</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://alcohol.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/4/what-should-we-do-when-a-question-already-has-an-answer-on-the-homebrewing-site"">What should we do when a question already has an answer on the Homebrewing site?</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>And lastly, I'd like to point back to an instance where I had many of the same thoughts I've seen re: homebrewing with another set of sites that I was involved in. The Sport.SE/Fitness.se meta crisis.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://sports.meta.stackexchange.com/q/96/6"">Sport.se and Fitness.se should be combined</a></li>

49,2,2014-01-27T16:00:25.597,15,,"<p>I tend to agree with you. I will be evaluating the private beta of ""Beer SE"" soon, and this is what has become evident to me as I watch this site develop:</p>

<p><strong>My Beer SE Evaluation</strong></p>

<p>The cross-cultural interests between ""Homebrew SE"" and ""Beer SE"" have way more overlap than I would have anticipated. I am <em>not</em> typically an advocate for combining producers and end users, but in this case, there is simply too much overlap of interests &mdash; not necessarily physical audiences, but <em>interests</em> &mdash; to ignore.</p>

<p>Hypothetically, if we were to remove the ""brewing-related questions"" from Beer SE (I'm not suggesting that), this site would become one big snooze fest fast. After I figure out what temperature to keep my beer&hellip; and how to keep it going skunky, just about the only <em>interesting</em> questions left are those that DO veer into what goes behind the brewing process. The deeper ""consumers"" here are asking about the ""artisanship""&hellip; and that's the <em>best</em> part of this site.</p>

<p>It makes sense, really. When there's a fervent appreciation for a subject (at least food/drink space), the <strong>more-engaged experts almost <em>have</em> to delve behind the scenes</strong> to study what separates good brews from bad; to understand the parameters that go into what they're ""appreciating."" </p>

<p><strong>You don't have to be a literal ""brewer/craftsman"" to have an implicit interest in the subject.</strong> Many of the beer enthusiasts here are curious about the craft &mdash; you almost <em>have</em> to, to appreciate the subject &mdash; and that's why they are asking about it here. And of course the craftsmen need to know what makes a good beer <strong>&hellip;</strong> so there's a lot of cross-cultural interests here, whether you an actual, literal ""home brewer"" not. </p>

<p>It simply makes sense to combine these subjects. While the brewers and consumers are not physically the same exact audience, they <strong><em>do</em></strong> largely seem to have the same range of interests&hellip; and questions. Essentially, the scope of these two sites overlap considerably; much more than I would have anticipated.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/LtPf9.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Put them back together. They will be stronger in combining their expertise; stronger for sharing their mutual interests and appreciation for the subject.</p>

<p><strong>Although H.SE and B.SE have very similar audiences right now, they'll probably diverge later</strong>.</p>

<p>To put it another way, the people likely to commit to both sites are pretty similar, but the people likely to <em>visit</em> each site is significantly different.  The people who are interested in beer enough to go out and help found a community like B.SE are far more likely to brew than the average mild beer enthusiast.</p>

<p>As such, I predict that we'll get more and more non-brewers as we exist public beta.  Keeping the sites separate will serve those people better than a combined one.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>For more insight I've wrote a <a href=""https://softwareengineering.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/403/what-is-our-site-and-community-about"">detailed post about Elevator Pitches</a> in the past.</p>

<p>As it helps to define the site we should be starting this early, here is the post he made on other sites:</p>

<p><strong>Let's start with a killer ""elevator pitch!""</strong></p>

<h2>The Elevator Pitch</h2>

<p>This isn't as easy as it sounds. Imagine the user who will never read your FAQ and you have two seconds to grab their attention. It should be catchy but descriptive. It should be thoroughly clear but painfully concise. <strong>Make every... word... count.</strong> </p>

<p>Here are some creative examples: </p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://gawker.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gawker</a>: Daily Manhattan media news and gossip. Reporting live from the center of the universe. </li>
<li><a href=""http://gizmodo.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gizmodo</a>: The gadget guide. So much in love with shiny new toys, it’s unnatural. </li>
<li><a href=""http://www.autoblog.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Autoblog</a>: We obsessively cover the auto industry. </li>
<li><a href=""http://www.dumblittleman.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DumbLittleMan</a>: So what do we do here? Well, it’s simple. 15 to 20 times per week we provide tips that will save you money, increase your productivity, or simply keep you sane. </li>
<li><a href=""http://www.needcoffee.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Needcoffee.com</a>: We are the Internet equivalent of a triple espresso with whipped cream. Mmmm…whipped cream. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Use it as a Tagline</h2>

<p>A shorter elevator pitch <em>can</em> be used as a tagline&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;something you can display in the header at the top of the page. If it doesn't fit, consider shortening it or creating a separate tagline. Here are some great examples: </p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://slashdot.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Slashdot</a>: News for nerds. Stuff that matters. </li>
<li><a href=""http://www.lifehacker.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lifehacker</a>: Don’t live to geek, geek to live! </li>
<li><a href=""http://www.thesimpledollar.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Simple Dollar</a>: Financial talk for the rest of us. </li>
</ul>

<h2>The Motto (don't forget your logo)</h2>

<p>A logo begs for it own little, short tagline&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;like a motto. Maybe the tagline inspires the logo; Maybe it's the other way around. Mottos make good t-shirt, bumper stickers, and other marketing material. Either way, you'll recognize a good motto when you see it: </p>

<ul>
<li>Just do it. </li>
<li>Think Different. </li>
<li>The Uncola. </li>
<li>Intel inside. </li>
<li>Like a rock. </li>
<li>The king of beers. </li>
</ul>

<p>&hellip;and perhaps all this leads to a proper name and domain for your site&hellip; <em>eventually</em>. So let's start from the basics. <strong>Come up with a killer elevator pitch, tagline, and/or motto!</strong> </p>

<p>Do you think we need a policy on links to external audio files? Obviously as we're dealing with production we're going to end up with people asking things like ""Why does my mix sound flat?""/whatever, and I think we're going to see a lot of people posting links to the track on SoundCloud or rapidshare etc.</p>

<p>Should we be encouraging this kind of thing?</p>

<p>I think that on one hand it will encourage more specific questions and answers, but on the other hand it leaves us open to people abusing the site as a place to get some attention for their music (this happens a lot on forums, I'm guessing it'll happen here).</p>

<p>I also know that on StackOverflow posting links to external code is generally frowned upon, but it's a lot easier to condense code down to a few lines for a question than it is for audio !</p>

16,2,2015-07-14T19:41:03.737,4,,"<p>It is true that in historical textual witnesses many words were written without dots (or were only incompletely equipped with dots). In fact, some materials are (almost entirely) devoid of dots at all. What we get in these manuscripts and testimonies is the bare <em>rasm</em>, i.e., the skeleton of the word, like كىٮ , which could be <em>kuntu</em> or <em>kataba</em>, and so on. In many cases, there will be no problem for a learned scribe or reader to understand the text, as the context will usually provide enough pieces of information for what the words could (or should) be.</p>

<p>This being said, it is clear that there is a certain (sometimes even high) degree of ambiguity that arises from missing dots. So, scribes often added at least some dots (but not all of them) to disambiguate more sufficiently.</p>

<p>Here is an example (probably 7th/13th century):
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/MKNzI.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Nowadays, scholars working with historical texts nonetheless have a lot to do in finding out how the dotless words should properly be interpreted. This is due to the fact that they are a couple of hundred years removed from the environment of the text which they investigate and are not fully familiar with the habits and customs of, say, an Egyptian scribe of rural documents in the 9th century or with the layout of petitions from the Mamlūk period. The more information scholars can collect of these customs and habits the more securely can they interpret those texts, i.e. the more one knows about the context the easier can one read the text.</p>

<p>Other than that, it should be added that even with all dots supplied, there are ambiguous cases, as some word patterns are identical, e.g. the active or passive voice of most participles (مفعل could be <em>mufaʿʿil</em> vs. <em>mufaʿʿal</em> or even <em>mufʿil</em> or <em>mufʿal</em>), or a imperfect verb in the the first stem (بفعل : <em>yafʿalu</em>) could also be a verb in the second stem (<em>yufaʿʿilu</em>) or fourth stem (<em>yufʿilu</em>), or even the passive voice of these (i.e., <em>yufʿalu</em> or <em>yufaʿʿalu</em> or again <em>yufʿalu</em>, respectively). Nowadays we tend to add vowel-signs but these were even more absent from most historical (especially non-religious) texts than dots.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The article <em>al-</em> always takes ""a"".</p></li>
<li><p>Verbs of the VII. (<em>infaʿala</em>), VIII. (<em>iftaʿala</em>, IX. (<em>ifʿalla</em>) and X. stem (<em>istafʿala</em>) (as well as the XI., XII., XIII., XIV., and XV., which are extremely rare) have the <em>alif al-waṣl</em> of their perfect/past stem pronounced as ""i"".</p></li>
<li><p>Verbs in the imperative mood have their <em>alif al-waṣl</em> pronounced as either ""i"" or ""u"".</p>

<ul>
<li>Verbs whose present tense contain ""i"" or ""a"" (e.g. <em>faʿala/yafʿ<strong>a</strong>lu</em>) take the <em>alif al-waṣl</em> of the imperative as ""i"" (<em>ifʿal</em> : ""do!"").</li>
<li>Some verbs whose present tense contain ""u"" in the middle (e.g. <em>ḫaraǧa/yaḫr<strong>u</strong>ǧu</em>) take the <em>alif al-waṣl</em> of the imperative as ""u"" (<em>uḫruǧ</em> : ""get out!"").</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>As for nouns, they also usually take ""i"" (as <em>ibn</em> or <em>ism</em>).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It is important to note that the <em>alif al-waṣl</em> is also not written in some cases, e.g. when the word is preceded by the prepositions <em>bi-</em> or <em>li-</em> or the particle <em>la-</em> (as for example in بسم الله : bi-smi llāhi).</p>

<p>Generally speaking, the reason for prefixing a <em>hamzat al-waṣl</em> or <em>alif al-waṣl</em> to a word is that the Arabic language avoids the existence of two consonant at the beginning of a word. Since verbs like <em>infaʿala</em> or nouns like <em>ibn</em> and imperatives like <em>uḫruǧ</em> would -- without an <em>alif al-waṣl</em> -- begin with two consonants, one is orthographically required to add a vowel. This vowel, then, is pronounced only if the word in question is alone in isolation or at the beginning of a sentence or after a grammatical pause.</p>

<p>There may be other words which take on a vowel for the same reason, i.e. to avoid two consonants at the beginning of the word, but they keep it under any circumstances. Such words are, for example, often loanwords from other languages (e.g. Greek), which may take ""a"" (as in <em>aflāṭūn</em> : ""Plato"") or ""u"" (as in <em>usṭuquss</em> : ""element/letter""). This, then, is called <em>hamzat al-qaṭʿ</em>.</p>

<p>In your example from al-Fātiḥā, the word in question (<em>ihdinā</em>  : ""guide us!"") is an imperative from the verb hadā/yahdī. Since it contains ""i"" in its present tense, it takes ""i"" in its imperative.</p>

<p>رُفِعَ ""قبلُ"" بناءا في محل الجر، و البناء اتى لتجرد الاسم ""قبلُ"" من الاضافة، الاصل او السهل المتبادر للذهن، هو ان يتبع الاسم ""قبلُ"" بمضاف اليه فيجر كما هو معتاد عليه، </p>

<p>كقوله تعالى : ""وَلَوْ شَاءَ اللَّهُ مَا اقْتَتَلَ الَّذِينَ <code>مِنْ بَعْدِهِمْ</code> <code>مِنْ بَعْدِ مَا جَاءَتْهُمُ</code> الْبَيِّنَاتُ"".</p>

<p><strong>English</strong></p>

<p>The word ""قبلُ"" came with a ""ُ "" instead of a ""ِ "" because it didn't come in the state of <code>Moudhaf</code> ""مضاف"" and because it wasn't tied with a <code>Moudhaf ilayh</code> ""مضاف اليه"", if it were so, it would come with a <code>Kasrah</code> ""ِ "" as it is in the verse :</p>

<p>If someone said لغة nobody would understand which language are you referring to! Another example if someone said وجه (or face) ! Which face do you mean? he must determine what he is saying</p>

<p>The words like لغة or وجه are ""a common part"" of many things i.e. the لغة may be English, French etc. and the وجه may be the face of a bird or the face of a human etc.</p>

<p>If you said وجه الإنسان (or the face of the human) then by adding the word الإنسان you made it clear and this part (الإنسان) by adding the face to it we understand that the face belongs to the human and this made the sentence defined and clear  so, you can add the language to the people you may say لغة العرب the language of the arab people.</p>

<p>This is adding a word to another one, for example you can add your hand to yourself so we can say يدك means your hand, you can say لغتي my language also لغة الكتاب the language of the book.</p>

<p>Another thing is to describe something to be with a particular attribute like saying يد رفيعة means a thin hand also you may describe your tongue to be arabic if you speak arabic لسان عربي means arabic tongue</p>

<p>So, the point is there is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Describing a word with an adjective like اللغة العربية</li>
<li>Adding a word to another word لغة العرب</li>
</ol>

<p>But لغة العربية is like you have deleted something from the sentence (and this is alright you can delete it so it's grammatically correct) the sentence without deleting anything is لغة اللغة العربية which means the language of the arabic language! it may be like a clue! what's the language of this language? or another example وجه الوجه الإنساني the face of the human face? what! is the face of this face? is it another face in his face?!</p>

<p>So, the difference is the face is the whole thing not a thing which is added to it like a nose you may say أنف الوجه the nose of the face but not أنف الأنف the nose of the nose!!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The word <em>baʿdu</em>, with the <em>Damma</em> inflection and no nunation, acts as an adverb in negative clauses to mean &lsquo;not...yet,&rsquo; &lsquo;still ... not.&rsquo; When inflected with the <em>Damma</em>, it cannot be the first term of a genitive construct.<sup>12</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This doesn't answer the question, but the footnote is very interesting:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><sup>12</sup>The <em>Damma</em> is not thought to represent the nominative case here but is rather an archaic form of Semitic locative &ldquo;un ancien cas adverbial en <em>-u</em> qui n'est pas le nominatif&rdquo; (Lecomte 1968, 90). Similar forms such as <em>qabl-u</em> &lsquo;before&rsquo;, <em>fawq-u</em> &lsquo;above,&rsquo; and <em>taHt-u</em> &lsquo;beneath&rsquo; also exist, with the restriction that they may not occur as the first term of an <em>ʾiDaafa</em>. On this topic see also Fleisch 1961, I:280, and Chapter 16, section 3.4.3.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Following up the reference to Chapter 16, there is another interesting footnote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><sup>13</sup> The final <em>Damma</em> on <em>baʿd-u</em> and on certain other semi-prepositions (<em>qabl-u</em>, <em>taHt-u</em>) is considered to be a remnant of an old locative case. This <em>Damma</em> has two characteristics: (1) it is invariable, even after a preposition (e.g., <em>min qabl-u</em>; <em>min taHt-u</em>); (2) it cannot be on the first term of an <em>ʾiDaafa</em>, that is, it cannot be followed by a noun in the genitive case or by a pronoun suffix. See chapter 11, section 4.1.3, especially note 12.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This suggests that the <em>-u</em> ending is a remnant of what used to be another case in proto-Semitic, but by Qur'anic times was only visible in a few words that behave differently to what you expect.</p>

<p>There is a common type of Arabic called ""classical Arabic"" (fusha) which stretches back at least 1000 years back. It's still used today for most media (eg. newspapers, textbooks) and in universities.</p>

<p>Beyond this, each country has its own dialect (or slang) version of Arabic. This includes both use of vocabulary, and also actual grammar (or ignoring the classical grammar).</p>

<p>While some of the sample questions on Area 51 talk about Arabic in a specific area, the question is really how we should plan and organize questions, or whether we should focus exclusively on classical Arabic.</p>

<li><strong>Answerability:</strong> Like above, if we don't have site users who know that specific version of Arabic (and in sufficient depth and detail to give a strong answer), we'll end up with a bunch of open, unanswerable questions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ultimately, we can let this play out (allowing country-specific Arabic questions) and see what happens. As a start, we should at least try to <em>tag country-specific Arabic questions appropriately.</em></p>

<p>For native speakers, the regional dialects form a large portion of Arabic as it's spoken today.  For learners, learning at least one dialect is often considered a necessary part of learning the Arabic language (and is pretty important if you actually want to visit a country).</p>

<p>This does mean we should be careful with tagging questions, and it also means we should be open to questions having multiple answers corresponding to different regions.  But the StackExchange format is well-suited to that, and other sites handle the same issue fine.  (For instance, on Academia, many questions have multiple answers with begin by explaining which fields the answer is relevant to.)</p>

<p>One final point: fusha refers to both Classical Arabic and Modern Standard Arabic.  These languages are pretty similar, but there are some usage differences.  So whether or not we include the regional dialects, we should keep in mind that some questions may have multiple answers depending on the language variant (and tag accordingly).</p>

It is called Arabic mainly because of the race, not because of the language itself. </p>

<p>Anyway, same thing is applicable now, the classical Arabic we see now is mainly from Quran and Current Quran is mainly from the Quraish version (one of the seven dialects). In addition to that, each country/region/tribe of Arabs has its own dialect/accent, nothing new here as this was the case throughout history. </p>

<p>To answer your question, this site should be about all Arabic Language variants (classic or dialects) especially that almost all Arabs are capable of understanding each other mutually with no problems.</p>

5,2,2015-07-14T20:06:44.950,7,,"<p>As I see it, this issue can be broken into two distinct concerns:</p>

<ol>
<li>Should we as a site cater to questions <em>about</em> dialectual variants of Arabic?</li>
<li>Should we as a site encourage posts <em>written</em> in dialectual variants of Arabic?</li>
</ol>

<p>For the first case, I think questions <em>about</em> different dialects should be allowed, for much the same reason Henry mentioned: <a href=""http://meta.arabic.stackexchange.com/a/3/10"">The regional dialects form a large portion of Arabic as it's spoken today</a>. Cutting dialects out of the scope would likely cut out a significant majority of our potential activity.</p>

<p>For the second case, however, I feel that there's value in establishing some clear guidelines to prevent the site from just becoming a mish-mash of dialects. I would suggest the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Consider English and Fusha as the ""official"" languages of this site</p>

<ul>
<li>Assuming that the majority of our users can (a) understand Fusha, and (b) understand English, seems to be a reasonable compromise (short of just abandoning English-language entirely, which given most of the posts on the site so far (including this meta) are written in English is probably going to be a hard sell)</li>
<li>Using regional dialects in meta discussions should be expressly discouraged; community opinion can only truly be gauged if the bulk of the community can reasonably <em>understand</em> what is being discussed, and many Arabic dialects are not mutually understandable. </li>
<li>Meta posts, policy discussions, FAQs with any sort of ""official"" weight <em>must</em> be written in one or the other (ideally both).

<ul>
<li>Any meta posts which the Stack Exchange community team (rather than just the site community/moderators) may need to be aware of must be written in English, as few if any of them are fluent in Arabic. In particular, this would include things like bug reports and feature requests.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Allow questions on the main page in regional dialects, but only if they're expressly <em>about</em> some aspect of that dialect, and <em>tagged appropriately</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Users should be allowed to ask questions in the manner which is most comfortable to them when possible; using their own dialect seems safe, so long as any possible answer would be relevant to that dialect</li>
<li>It is reasonable to assume that any experts capable of answering a question <em>about</em> a particular dialect is also <em>fluent</em> in that particular dialect. Conversely, it is reasonable to assume that any experts <em>not</em> fluent in that particular dialect are poorly qualified to answer questions <em>about</em> that particular dialect.</li>
<li>This allows users fluent/not-fluent in particular dialects to selectively ignore/highlight/select questions that they can actually understand based on tags.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Insist that answers on the main page only use dialect if the question is written in that dialect.

<ul>
<li>English questions should get English answers, and Arabic questions should get Arabic answers.</li>
<li>Even if a question is tagged with a dialect, if it's asked in (a) Fusha, or (b) English, so must the answer be written</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>In short, the only time a dialect should be used is if it&hellip;</p>

<ol>
<li>&hellip;is a question about and tagged with that particular dialect, or</li>
<li>&hellip;is an answer posted to a question using that dialect.</li>
</ol>

<p>Otherwise, either Fusha or English should be used.  From my understanding (I am hardly an Arabic native) Fusha is rather universally <em>understood</em> among Arabic speakers, even when it's rarely if ever actually <em>spoken</em>. So establishing it as the <em>lingua franca</em> of Arabic here makes sense to me.</p>

<p>Many users of the proposal signed up specifically for the questions about the dialects of the language as such we need to come up with a plan to support this otherwise we will drive people away.</p>

<p>As such this is not a question of ""if"" but ""how"".</p>

<p>On the proposal we hinted that classical (Fusha) Arabic was the default dialect of all questions/answers and I see no reason to change that.</p>

<p>However, the big question, of which some of these answers try to solve, is how to deal with dialects when they do arise.</p>

<p>Having read @GoldPseudo's answer it seems he knows what he is on about and his ideas seem sound. </p>

<p>It makes sense that if someone asks in English it is likely that they are a student or learner of Arabic, as such the answers should probably be English as well. Likewise, if the question is in Arabic there is no use writing in a totally different language (English) since that person is speaking Arabic, and this is Arabic SE after-all.</p>

<p>We should probably encourage this stance and punish those who do not follow it with downvotes to try and create some norm, else I can see this quickly becoming a mess.</p>

<p>We should also allocate tags for dialects as suggested. We need to be more careful about this last point though and I am still unclear exactly how we should structure this. It might come down to just seeing what actual users do and then cleaning their process up into something workable.</p>

<p>Now back to the topic: whether a question can be answered or not is not based on whether or not the answer is short. Take some of the best network questions, they can be pages long at times.

<p>A basic moderation task is to make sure that new questions are tagged appropriately. This means adding missing tags and removing inappropriate tags, and possibly adding a comment pointing the user to the tag-wiki to explain proper use of a particular tag.</p>

<p>Ordinarily with a downvote I don't understand I'd shrug and say ""downvotes happen"", but three on the same question - and with only one upvote - make me think there must be something seriously wrong with the answer.</p>

<p>However, the only <a href=""http://arabic.stackexchange.com/questions/39/are-there-any-silent-letters-in-arabic/54#comment204_54"">comments</a> left on the answer complain that the word ""مائة"" was misspelt.

<li>Does the answer not address the question? (I believe it does since it contains words in which not all the letters are pronounced.)</li>
<li>Is there some error in what the answer claims? (I've added references to back up what I say.)</li>
<li>Is it defective in some other way?</li>
</ul>

<p>And, in general, how should the answer be improved?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Too Localized was, by far, the most misused close reason in our surveys, with both Community Managers and Moderators deeming over 50% of randomly sampled TL closures to not have merited closure (including on SO).</p>
  
  <p>Today, TL <em>is</em> used helpfully on code dump questions on SO, but the new OT reasons are where this is now correctly addressed. SO can use ""Large blocks of code with requests for debugging without meaningful supporting info"" as a specific OT reason.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what does this mean for Arabic? Well, with enough consensus, the community could add a custom off-topic close reason for cases like these. But in the meantime it's important to think through why a ""too localized"" question is actually bad for Arabic Language SE. </p>

<p>One result of ""too localized"" being removed as a network-wide close reason is that communities are now better able to decide for themselves that constitutes a useful question. On a language site like Arabic, many questions would qualify as what used to be ""too localized"" on Stack Overflow. They answer one person's question, but they don't always solve a common problem people have when writing or speaking Arabic that they'll end up searching for.</p>

<p>And yet, <strong>we still find such questions (examples: <a href=""http://arabic.stackexchange.com/q/43/45"">1</a>, <a href=""http://arabic.stackexchange.com/q/47/45"">2</a>) valuable</strong><sup>1</sup> as we build a compendium of knowledge about Arabic--and a community of knowledgeable people who like learning and teaching about Arabic concepts and history.</p>

<p>So, tl;dr: </p>

<ol>
<li>""Too Localized"" was removed as a close reason deliberately.</li>
<li>If this community finds questions like those to be counterproductive or bad for the site, they can still be closed with custom reasons.</li>
<li>But I'm not as sure as you are that they should be closed.</li>

<p>I don't know of a workaround for the first two issues - I think the SE folks need to add support for the <code>dir=""rtl""</code> attribute on a number of tags - at the very least <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>. Or perhaps start using <code>dir=""auto""</code></p>

<p>The third issue (parentheses/quotes/etc), at least, can be worked around by adding a Unicode ""right-to-left marker"" character at the end of the text (after the ""broken"" punctuation). This can either be an explicit character (U+200F), or the corresponding HTML entity <code>&amp;#x200f;</code> (or <code>&amp;rlm;</code>). For example:</p>

<p><strong>Original (broken)</strong></p>

<p>كلمة عربية (شرح).</p>

<p><strong>Using a literal RLM character after the "".""</strong></p>

<p>كلمة عربية (شرح).‏</p>

<p><strong>Using an HTML entity</strong></p>

<p>كلمة عربية (شرح).&rlm;</p>

<p>Adding the HTML entity is easy (you can just type <code>&amp;rlm;</code> into the edit window), but the trouble is that, although the final (rendered) text looks good, the text in the edit box is still all in the wrong order (and looks worse because now you have the extra <code>&amp;rlm;</code> cluttering things up).</p>

<p>Adding the literal character is trickier, but it makes the edited text look good too. One option, on Windows, is to use Notepad, and choose ""Insert Unicode Control Character -> RLM"" from the menu - then copy and paste into the edit window.</p>

<li><strong>The nominee should indicate their acceptance</strong> by editing the answer (not commenting) to say they accept. Optionally, nominees are encouraged to write a bit about themselves following the nomination. You can use the <code>---</code> markup to separate the nominee's commentary from the original nomination. See the example below.</li>

51,1,2015-07-28T15:17:04.473,3,50,"<p>I have a question about an Arabic word – specifically, how to appropriately morph the word to make it diminutive – because I wish to use the word and its morphed (diminutive) form in an English writing project. I do not know any Arabic, and while I have attempted to research this topic, my knowledge of Arabic is too limited to feel confident that I have correctly understood what I have found.</p>

<p>It may be that it is not appropriate to ask such a question here; I know during the 51 phase there was a question regarding questions in English and a desire at least among some users to keep them limited to truly sincere students of the language – and sadly, I do not have the time to be that. The answers to this question suggested to me that this site is really primarily for people who already speak Arabic, not for teaching English speakers (that is, that the site is the Arabic analogue of the English Language &amp; Usage site, <em>not</em> the English Language Learners site).</p>

<p>On the other hand, the existing <a href=""http://meta.arabic.stackexchange.com/q/8/275"">meta question</a> on the subject does suggest that it is open to all levels, the analogue of ELL as well as EL&amp;U. I assume that this more-recent discussion is more reflective of the community that is actually here, but I wish to be sure. Moreover, it may be that my question is too basic to even qualify me as a “beginning student,” as indeed, I am not studying the language as a whole.</p>

<p>I wish to respect this community, and if my question is not appropriate, I will not ask it. It is important for new Stack Exchange sites to set boundaries on what is on-topic, and to try to avoid setting precedents that will cause trouble in the future. I will simply move forward with what I have found and hope it’s close enough so that Arabic speakers who read my work can appreciate what I was going for (since the work is in English, context will be sufficient to understand the distinction for those who understand no Arabic; I merely would like for Arabic speakers to see it as “right.”)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Avoid “easy” questions</p>
  
  <p>It’s tempting to start with easy, superficial questions: surveys, polls, and rudimentary questions like “what are some good books on this topic” or “what are the best blogs on this topic”. Those are not good questions for the private beta – they don’t reflect the actual content that we want this site to contain, and are not representative of it.</p>

<p>I think that there will be a rush to farm reputation on the first hours. Something similar was seen recently on <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/328703/addressing-documentation-repgateapocalypse"">stackoverflow-docs</a>. </p>

<p>I do not complain about the reputation itself, I was rather hoping that the site deals with topics more related with intelligence, deeper than the technical way to train an ANN or how to program a mobile robot in a specific platform. For that, we already have <a href=""https://stats.stackexchange.com/"">crossvalidated</a>, <a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/"">data science</a>, <a href=""https://electronics.stackexchange.com/"">electronics</a>, <a href=""https://robotics.stackexchange.com/"">robotics</a>, and stackoverflow itself. However, the first bunch of questions <em>will</em> define a path (am I right here?).</p>

<p>I understand that many of us got involved in the stackexchange network because we <em>solve</em> things in a sort of engineering way, but I think the site for AI has much more interesting questions (for instance <em>philosophy of AI</em>). The thing is, those questions cost more time and effort to ask and answer, so I could expect a slower pace than in stackoverflow or english sites.</p>

<p>I think all the scientists working on AI would be helpful here even though we're not working on implementation. This is what the original Area 51 Discussion post said (excerpted):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Data Science is an <em>applied</em> site for all the programmers/statisticians/mathematicians who are trying to make this stuff <em>work</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There's some leeway there. Specifically, technical questions seem to be OK, as long as they're not super in depth about the math or programming. There are also ""why"" questions (as opposed to ""how"") that are very interesting and educational. I like <a href=""https://ai.stackexchange.com/q/92/75"">this question</a> a lot. Scientists are welcome.</p>

46,2,2016-08-03T01:01:53.867,6,,"<p>First there is a need to distinguish modeling from implementation. They are not exactly the same, although strongly related. This was a very difficult lesson to learn among mathematicians and early programmers, notably in the 70s (mathematical proofs can demand a lot of non-trivial programming work to make them ""computable"", as in runnable on a computer).</p>

<p>As for Machine Learning (by far the most active AI category), modeling belongs to Data Science SE---perhaps the one thing that most people agree on. Implementation should be out of there, as the issues and focus differ (but again, they are related).</p>

<p>Now, should implementation issues be in AI SE, or StackOverflow? The recurring example is TensorFlow, who's home page states that questions should go to StackOverflow. And we should respect that...</p>

<p>But we should keep in mind that the TensorFlow team will choose SO, because it is the largest community, and because the team has something else to do rather than experimenting with hardly visible communities. Well, size matters. We may think that if AI SE becomes big enough on the implementation side, the TensorFlow team (and other major frameworks) may move actually.</p>

<p>In fact, I think now that implementation questions would benefit from a dedicated site (my view has evolved since the Area 51 definition phase). I have replied and tried to reply to several SO questions related to ML tools, and I think some are out of place compared to other questions. For example, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38321024/why-this-simple-tensorflow-code-is-not-successful-convnetjs-using-tensorflow/38368469#comment64172189_38368469"">some</a> TensorFlow questions are not really programming questions, and not really framework questions. I mean, there is background knowledge on graph construction and execution, as well as background knowledge about statistics and probabilities that are really necessary to make meaningful contributions.</p>

<p>This is not to say that <em>all</em> questions are out of place on SO. <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38297581/tensorflow-gpu-utilization-is-almost-always-at-0#comment64124967_38297581"">Some</a> are <em>really</em> framework issues or (Python) programming issues, and they are good there.</p>

<p>Based on this opinion, I think the site should be interested in implementation experts, whether they work on ML or Expert Systems (or both?).</p>

  <p>I'm seeing a lot of answers from people along the lines of ""AI is just bits and bytes and ultimately cannot be smarter than its creator because its creator would have to use their brain to make something smarter than themselves, which isn't possible.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this argument is a bit unclear and needs some refinement. It is true that AI can indeed be smarter than the creator at certain tasks (AlphaGo being better at Go than the programmers of AlphaGo, for instance). What I think this argument is really saying is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""AI is just bits and bytes programmed by its creator. The creator would be able to <em>know</em> how the AI works, otherwise he would be unable to create it in the first place. Therefore, the creator can be said to be <em>superior</em> to that of its creation, since the creator can understand its creation.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That seems like a more logical premise. Sure, AlphaGo is better at Go than the programmers of AlphaGo, but AlphaGo's programmers actually knows how AlphaGo operates. This type of argument was made in the paper <a href=""http://kryten.mm.rpi.edu/lovelace.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Creativity, the Turing Test, and the (better) Lovelace Test</a>, which specifically argues that  AIs cannot be creative since programmers are able to figure out what their creations (AIs) are doing. Another paper <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.6142v3.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">""The Lovelace 2.0 Test of Artificial Creativity and Intelligence""</a> saw this argument as so self-evidently true that it tried to create a weaker version of the Lovelace Test to identify and measure AI creativity.</p>

<p>The programmers, basically, know how their program works. That doesn't mean the program is less intelligent than the programmers. Just that the programmers can understand why their programs behave the way they do, given enough time and patience.</p>

<p>Either way, I would not support discouraging answers such as these, if only because this view does have support within the AI scholarly community. If you have experts who hold this view, then we should let this view be given exposure.</p>

9,2,2017-08-02T19:49:14.807,4,,"<p>The final fallback for market resolution (after all reporters have reported on an event and someone still believes the answer is wrong) is called Fork Resolution.  Only one fork can be active at a time per branch (in Augur, a branch is akin to an entire universe that is isolated from other universes).  Once a fork starts, all other markets that are awaiting reporter based resolution (this does not include automated reporting) are delayed until the fork resolves.  Once the fork resolves, all of those pending markets will migrate to the branch (universe) that won the fork.</p>

<p>The fact that existing markets migrate to a particular world view is one of the first differences with AgnosticPM.  In AgnosticPM, the universe a market lives in is based entirely on markets that came before.  In Augur, while a market is created within a particular universe (branch), it will migrate forward to another branch if a fork occurs before the market settles.  The reason for this is because if a fork occurs, we must assume that reporters have been compromised and any reporting they do is invalid.  It is also assumed that the fork resolution process is the best answer we have to ""who was right"".</p>

<p>As for how the fork resolution process actually works, its pretty simple.  Before the fork, there is REP (tokens) that is associated with a particular branch (universe).  This REP is traded on exchanges and has some market value.  When a fork occurs, a new branch is created (conceptually) for every possible outcome and each branch has a new REP token.  Anyone who holds the original REP token can convert (1:1 ratio) their token to a REP token on <em>any</em> branch of the fork.  The act of converting your REP from the parent branch to a child is how you vote for which branch you think represents reality.  Once you have cast your vote, there is no going back so be certain!</p>

<p>At the end of the fork (currently ~2 months) whichever branch had the most REP migrated to it is considered the winner and all existing markets needing reporting will migrate to that branch, and share tokens for the forking market will be redeemed using the outcome from that branch.</p>

<p>This begs the question, why would I risk my REP casting a vote instead of just keeping my original REP?  The answer to this is that no new markets can be created on the original branch and all existing markets will resolve on the winning branch.  This means that REP on the original branch will yield no reporting fees to REP holders as there will be no markets to report on.  As a REP holder, your job is to pick the branch that you think the most future fees will come from.  This means you want to pick the branch that has the most market participation (volume/outstanding interest) so your REP gets the maximum amount of fees long term.  In almost all cases, this will be the branch that represents the truth/reality.  The only cases where this is less certain are forks that are highly contentious, where not everyone agrees on what reality even means.</p>

<p>In order to incentivize people to migrate their REP during the voting period (tentatively 2 months), there will likely be some small inflation assigned to everyone who migrates sooner rather than later (e.g., 5%).  The idea here is that if you pick a side (rather than abstaining) then your share of REP will <em>not</em> be diluted.  If you abstain, then your share of REP will be diluted by some amount relative to how many people migrate.  The goal here is to make it so abstaining from the vote is a losing strategy in almost all cases (non-contentious forks) as this increases the cost of mounting a forking attack against Augur.</p>

<p>Regarding AgnosticPM, Augur is <em>similar</em> in that it has a concept of branches (universes) which have a history of truths associated with them.  The primary difference between Augur and AgnosticPM is that Augur has a concept of finality, meaning that the system has the ability to assert that a particular outcome is an absolute truth for the sake of paying out winnings.  In AgnosticPM, there is no way to extract deposited ETH from the system, its ETH-in-only.  This is a pretty huge difference as it means that AgnosticPM, while fun and possibly effective, doesn't have a way of liquidating its ETH holdings back to participants to payout.  As long as AgnosticPM experiences heavy growth, this may not be a problem but if it ever ceases to experience usage growth then this becomes a big problem.  Investors know this, which will likely make them hesitant to buy any AgnosticPM share tokens, which is likely to drive their value to below 1 ETH (their target).</p>

<li><code>ShareToken</code>: The second most well known token, this is what you get when you buy shares in a market.  There is a unique instance of this token per outcome per market.  When the market closes and is finalized (reported on without contest), then the ShareToken that represents the winning outcome will be redeemable for full share value (minus fees) while all of the others will expire worthless.  You can buy a complete set of ShareTokens (meaning one of each outcome) for the cost of full share value, and if you acquire a complete set you can also sell them for full share value (minus fees).</li>
<li><code>RegistrationToken</code>: This is just a token you can buy for a fixed amount of REP that will enable you to report in the next reporting window.  If you don't register, you can still report (tentatively) but you will not be eligible for reporting fee payouts.  If you register and then show up for reporting, you will be able to redeem your RegistrationToken for the REP you paid to buy it.  If you don't show up, your registration fee will be forfeited.</li>
<li><code>ReportingToken</code>: As a reporter, when you participate in reporting you trade REP for ReportingTokens.

32,2,2017-08-03T05:06:05.003,14,,"<p>The parasite problem is as of yet unsolved.  Internally, the Augur team has referred to it as the problem of derivative financial markets.  The short version of the problem is that in order for REP to remain secure, the system needs to know the total value at risk so it can accurately assess how valuable REP must be in order to effectively secure that much value at risk.  If enough people have assets attached to Augur indirectly (in a way that Augur doesn't know how to account for) such that the cost of launching an attack against REP is less than the profit to be made from such an attack then the security model has broken down.</p>

<p>As the link you provided suggests, this is an as-of-yet unsolved problem.  The tentative plan is to move forward with recognition of this problem and closely monitor the system at launch.  If Augur is wildly successful, then it is <em>possible</em> that its internal volume will outpace derived volume.  In that case, we (the community) merely need to watch from the outside and pay attention to how much value is at risk in derivative markets.  If derivative markets start to surpass Augur's internal volume, then the first step is to approach the authors of the derivatives markets (off-chain, human interaction) and see if they would be willing to hook in to Augur's Oracle system more closely (and pay fees, which are presumed to likely be very low).  The reason one may choose to do this is because if they are dependent on Augur as an Oracle and the Oracle fails, they fail as well.  0.01% trading fee (or whatever it is) may be well worth it to someone who is big enough to be a risk to Augur's security model if it helps ensure their system remains secure.</p>

<p>For smaller fish, who may be less interested in ""contributing their fair share"" to system security, as long as Augur and big fish derivative markets <em>are</em> paying their fair share then the system is designed to handle a bit off lossiness in the value at risk calculations.</p>

<p>The real problem arrives if you have an actor that not only is wildly successful and dependent on Augur's Oracle, but is also unwilling to pay for the security costs that lead to their success.  In general, such an actor needs to either be uninformed as to the risk they are taking or not financially motivated.  At the moment, we aren't terribly worried about such actors in the ecosystem, and initially the Ethereum ecosystem is small enough that we can likely run a successful smear campaign against such an actor.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, Augur <em>does</em> want derivative markets (and other interesting things) built on top of the Augur Oracle.  As long as people doing this recognize that security isn't free, it is possible (likely?) that they will be willing to contribute the very small cost associated with maintaining enough security to cover their <em>own</em> security costs.</p>

<p>I believe this is where it fails.  REP holders <em>only</em> make money if they report on markets.  As an incentive for reporting on markets, REP holders are paid for their trouble and for the security the provide to the system.  Someone who just buys REP and sits around doing nothing will earn no fees.</p>

<p>By buying REP you are not only locking up an asset as part of participation in a crypto-economic security system (which the Howey Test and SEC don't really understand, so who knows how they will view it) but you are also effectively registering to participate in the reporting system (which is how you get fees).</p>

<p>My personal opinion is that specific comparison questions between Augur and other prediction markets should be allowed, with the ""Augur SE"" branding remaining in tact. </p>

<p>Augur is the first and largest decentralized prediction market as measured by community size and activity indicators such as <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Augur/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Reddit</a>, <a href=""https://twitter.com/AugurProject"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Twitter</a>, <a href=""https://twitter.com/alexsunnarborg/status/880874538317357056"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">unique ERC20 addresses</a>, and post crowdfunding development time but it will not be the last. Technical comparisons between Augur and later market entrants should be welcome here. Comparisons with existing (soon to be antiquated) centralized prediction markets may also prove useful to users of this Stack. In the long run, due to economies of scale, most questions will likely eventually be focused on Augur regardless.</p>

<p>Yes, almost certainly. There are members who are actively involved and very deserving of recognition. My inability to account for everyone this early on is in <em>no way</em> a slight against them.

<h2>What should our documentation contain?</h2>

<p>Much of the sites documentation will be the same as on every other Stack Exchange site: “be nice,” “how to create an account,” “how to ask questions” — it’s all pretty static. Even the sections about “what kind of questions should I (not) ask here?” comes primarily from <a href=""http://area51.stackexchange.com/faq#questions"">the Definition phase of Area 51</a>.</p>

<p>But the questions you want to discuss in meta are those issues specific to your site that need to be mentioned in the Help Center.</p>

<p>Take the <a href=""https://superuser.com/faq"">Super User ""About"" page</a> as an example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Super User is for computer enthusiasts and power users.</p>
  
  <p>Ask about...</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Specific issues with computer software, hardware or networking</li>
  <li>Real problems or questions that you’ve encountered</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Don't ask about...</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Anything not directly related to computer software or computer hardware</li>
  <li>Questions that are primarily opinion-based</li>
  <li>Questions with too many possible answers or require an extremely long answer</li>
  <li>Videogames, consoles, or other electronic devices, unless they connect to your computer</li>
  <li>Websites or web services like Google, Facebook, Twitter, and WordPress</li>
  <li>Shopping, buying or product recommendations</li>
  <li>Issues specific to corporate IT support and networks</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>These are then elaborated on in SU's <a href=""https://superuser.com/help/on-topic"">What topics can I ask about here?</a> page.</p>

<p>It took almost a year to figure out the list of “we want these sort of questions” and “we don’t want these sort of questions” on Super User. Area 51 gave you a head start but you should also be working out other FAQ-related issues <strong>specific to your topic and your community</strong>.</p>

  <li>Have a reasonably high reputation score to indicate active, consistent participation.</li>
  <li>Show an interest in their meta’s community-building activities.</li>
  <li>Lead by example, showing patience and respect for their fellow community members in everything they write.</li>
  <li>Exhibit those intangible traits discussed in <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/""><em>A Theory of Moderation</em></a>.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Bonus points for:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Members with participation in both meta and the parent site (i.e. interest in both community building and expertise in the field).</li>
  <li>Area 51 participation, social network referrals, or blogging about the site.</li>
  <li>Members who have already shown an interest or ability to promote their community.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Candidates will be contacted and three of them will be selected to act as provisional Moderators until the community holds formal elections after the Beta period. Besides the normal abilities of a Moderator, they will:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Have access to a special chat room where we will collectively work through the challenges of moderation and community self-policing.</li>
  <li>Organize the process of selecting the site's attributes (domain names, design issues, the FAQ, etc.).</li>
  <li>Rally community support and drive the mission of getting publicity for the site.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Essentially, <strong>they will have the ear of the Stack Exchange team for anything we can do to help their sites succeed!</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although the moderators pro tempore will ultimately be selected by Stack Exchange, the purpose of this post is to seek out and propose candidates:</p>

<ul>
<li>Each nomination should be posted as an answer and it should include (at minimum) a link to the user's main and meta profile so we can check out their activity.</li>
<li>Self nominations are encouraged, step up if you feel you can help.</li>
<li>If you are nominated by someone else you should edit the answer and let us know if you accept or decline (explanation optional). If a nominee declines we will not delete the answer, as to not have someone else nominate them again.</li>
<li>If you are nominating someone else, please mark the post as Community Wiki before saving. Meta doesn't allow suggested edits, so your nominee may be blocked from accepting the nomination.</li>
<li>The nominations are not binding to Stack Exchange or the nominees. If you are being considered by Stack Exchange, you will get an official confirmation email at one point. </li>
<li>Before nominating someone or accept / decline a nomination, you should read <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/""><em>A Theory of Moderation</em></a> thoroughly to find out what's generally expected from moderators.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you would like to learn more about the role, please drop into <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/34216/3d-printing"">chat room</a> where you can ask about the role from other moderators (they appear with a blue name in the chat room). Another chatroom called <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/2691/the-assembly"">The Assembly</a> was created specifically for users and moderators to discuss moderation activities, moderators from all over the network are there to answer your questions.</p>

<h2>What’s the “elevator pitch” for our site?</h2>

<p>Imagine you’ve just gotten on an elevator with a friendly stranger. You have precisely one floor to describe your community to them. What would you say? The elevator pitch is a brief sentence that describes <em>what your site is about</em>. Every word counts!</p>

<p>Once decided, it can be sliced and diced to form:</p>

<ul>
<li>the tagline</li>
<li>the motto</li>
<li>the blurb under the logo</li>
<li>a convenience redirect “nickname” for the site</li>
<li>perhaps eventually the domain name <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/domain-names/"">in some form</a></li>
</ul>

<p>(Due to a variety of <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/domain-names-the-wrong-question/"">practical difficulties with domain names</a>, we prefer to de-emphasize domain name selection. Most sites will retain their <code>topic.stackexchange.com</code> names indefinitely.)</p>

<p>Naming is hard — <em>really</em> hard. But if you can come up with a sensible elevator pitch for your community, it’s a great starting point.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I printed a crane mechanism in 3D. How much voltage must I apply to the motor to lift 150 grams?</p>

<p>I see this type of thing all the time. Users will go to the mat arguing that they are printing in 3D, so their question is on topic. It is not. The actual <em>expertise</em> needed to answer this question is in electronics. With a question like this, the premise that the user <em>happens</em> to be printing in 3D is entirely coincidental to the actual issue. </p>

<p>The examples you cited above are a bit more iffy. I might argue some of them could (potentially) be on topic&hellip; if the issue of the material being printed in 3D is somehow germane to the problem. I actually don't know enough about the subject to say, so I'm only considering the possibility that it <em>is</em> relevant to this subject space.</p>

<p>Let's not be too quick to start barring questions that aren't explicitly about the physical process of 3D printing literally.

The process of when and how this happens <em>has</em> been in flux more recently, but typically a logo contest is not really part of that process. But who knows&hellip; I've been floating various suggestions about how to get the community looped back in that process. </p>

<p>There are often cases when I am googling a difficult problem because I cannot do ""alternative a"" as suggested by the answerer.  Then, I get to an SE question that asked about exactly the situation I am having.  An answer of ""Don't do that, do this instead"" is upvoted, accepted, and the only answer.  Thus, I am unable to solve my problem using SE.  In other words, the Answer didn't apply to the question, and so SE led me down the wrong path.</p>

30,1,2016-01-13T06:06:45.117,8,82,"<p><strong>A big shout out to all of us for a successful graduation into private beta. 
Let's make it a success now, and make sure we graduate into a full-fledged site. 
So, this is one post which every user of a private beta site should read and act accordingly.</strong></p>

<p>This is a reproduction of a moderator's (Richard) <a href=""https://hermeneutics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/49"">post on meta.hermeneutics.SE</a>; I believe it is very much applicable to this community as well. Richard wrote a post encouraging voting. I think this is a big issue because rep is the basis of our ""economy"", encourages (good) user activity, sorts out our content and makes the site look active. In particular <strong>Question Votes</strong> make the site look more active.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I cannot state this strongly enough.  Voting is <em>absolutely critical</em> to the formation of a healthy SE site.  And this is never more true than in Private and early Public beta.  </p>
  
  <h3>Vote on Questions</h3>
  
  <p>Voting allows the community to determine what topics are allowed and what are not.  Voting shows what constitutes a well-formed question and what is unacceptable for this community.</p>
  
  <p>If you need help formulating better questions, the blog post <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/asking-better-questions/"">Asking Better Questions</a> might help you out.  (Admittedly, it's geared towards the Stackoverflow crowd, but the philosophies there will help).  Also, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/how-to-ask"">How to Ask</a> directly from StackOverflow is an excellent resource.</p>
  
  <p>Finally, I want to reiterate that <strong>Voting on questions  is free!</strong>  It doesn't cost you any reputation to to vote a question down.  (Compared to answers:)</p>
  
  <h3>Vote on Answers</h3>
  
  <p>Voting on answers allows a dramatic increase in reputation.  Like questions, it shows that you believe and support the answer provided.  Also, vote answers up that you think are well worded and support the answer given.  </p>
  
  <p><em>You don't have to agree with an answer to vote it up!</em></p>
  
  <p>To show that this is true, they've even created a <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/badges/63/sportsmanship"">badge for voting up competing answers (called ""Sportsmanship"")</a>.</p>
  
  <p>If you think an answer is <em>useful</em>, vote it up.  If you think an answer is <em>not useful</em>, vote it down.  Either way, <strong>vote</strong>!</p>
  
  <p>If you need help on writing answers, the meta post <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/7656/how-do-i-write-a-good-answer-to-a-question"">How do I write a good answer to a question?</a> will help you out.</p>
  
  <h3>Final thoughts</h3>
  
  <p>If people do not vote, there won't be enough reputation on this site for it to be promoted.  Reputation is very important to a StackExchange site as it creates the groups of people capable of maintaining the site.</p>
  
  <p>To show how critical it is, Jeff Atwood posted a blog article regarding this topic: <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/vote-early-vote-often/"">Vote Early, Vote Often</a></p>
  
  <h3>Encourage others to vote!</h3>
  
  <p>Quoting RobertCartaino from chat:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>Vote, vote, vote. Encourage others to vote, vote, vote. On good content, leave signposts (""If you like this, please vote it up. It's important for the community!"")-- in both meta and the main site. Maybe a few meta posts informing the users of the important of that type of participation. You are empowered a lot more than you know.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Don't upvote bad content (edit/suggest how to fix it instead) but make sure you remember to vote, especially for questions; if you learned something from an answer on a question, the question's probably worth an upvote too so others can find the good information.</p>

43,2,2016-01-13T14:27:07.137,1,,"<h3>Technological issues</h3>

<p>Stack Exchange works hard for its communities, but there is a limit. If thingiverse changes its API (which it can, and does, do at any time without notice) then anything we build on it has to be modified, and users will be very whiny until it's fixed.</p>

<p>If we choose to integrate model viewing or any sort of API integration with an outside service, we will have to make sure the service provides some sort of legacy guarantee minimal API that won't change, and then we will only be able to use that.  </p>

<h3>Political issues</h3>

<p>I would be very uncomfortable endorsing a closed source, commercial service on this site.  There are many communities within the world of 3D printing that are very unhappy with makerbot, thingiverse, and their parent company, and encouraging users to use this service may result in pushing away some very valuable experts within the reprap world.</p>

<h3>Looking to the future</h3>

<p>If we integrate any sort of model library or model viewer, I strongly suggest we choose an open source project the community can heartily endorse.  We may link to outside models, but the core API should be servable by stack exchange without license or much maintenance so 1) we don't have to deal with API changes messing us up, 2) we don't rely on outside services that may change their terms of use or API, 3) we don't have to form complicated contract bound relationships with 3rd parties just to get the guarantees we'd need to convince Stack Exchange to invest in a new feature, and 4) we don't become too politically involved such that we disenfranchise users who may have very strong feelings about this subject.</p>

<h3>Wait and see</h3>

<p>This is the early beta.  Let's find out what people link to in questions before dedicating resources to improving the links/plug-ins/oneboxes.  It may be that thingiverse objects are linked to frequently, and that it would add value to the site to improve that experience, but it's also just as likely that thingiverse turns out to be infrequently linked and the effort spent now would essentially have been wasted.  Let's wait until we have tens of thousands of questions so we can properly evaluate what the community actually uses and needs.</p>

45,2,2016-01-13T14:57:44.823,2,,"<p>The ultimate goal of any answer should be to <strong>solve the problem that the asker is facing</strong>. Sometimes that involves not going to what they directly wrote, because sometimes that's not the most effective way to go about it. For much the same as there are people who can't use alternatives, there are people who didn't <em>think</em> about the alternative options in the first place. It's very easy when some askers run into a problem, to tunnel-vision that ""I must solve it this way"" and then someone provides a very enlightening view by working outside the box the asker had situated inside. </p>

<p>That said, this is also part of the very nature as to why these sites permit more than one answer to a question. It is to allow different routes to solve the same problem. Some will be the direct route that is asked, others will take shortcuts as they see fit.</p>

<p>It remains though that naturally, sometimes an alternative, be it a particular one or just in general, is not permissible. When this is the case, that kind of a restriction is <em>part of the problem</em>. As such if the asker can't work with a given alternative, and if the only answers they're getting is that alternative, it's to them to modify their question to exclude that alternative as an option. Or if it is a known quantity to begin with, a pre-emptitive exclusion present in the question when asked is very appropriate. On the other side, if a reader happens upon a question and cannot utilize the alternatives that exist there, then they are welcome to recreate the question in a fashion which excludes the alternatives since their situation cannot cater to it.</p>

<p>Sans such an explicit exclusion, if the asker can work with the alternative, or if they still receive other answers that do not employ that alternative, there's no foul going on as a result. It's fine to dislike something being provided as an alternative, but it's by no means something we're going to discourage on a level to the point of flagging. Downvotes, those are yours to give as you see fit to things that you believe are not helpful - I could say something like ""It's probably more appropriate to downvote if a particular alternative is actively unhelpful to you, as opposed to a post which you stumble across in random browsing which just <em>happens</em> to be an alternative"", but at the same vein, you could still deem it unhelpful and the vote is yours to cast. Just be open to the fact that if the alternative <em>does</em> work for other people, it's going to remain acceptable on the site.</p>

<p>First, overlap between sites is fine. <em>It doesn't matter if a question is on topic somewhere else</em>; that's no reason to eliminate it from a different site's scope. There were some issues when HSM sprang up, because Mathematics, Physics, and other sites allowed history-related questions. I participated in several meta discussions on these sites.

<p>Regulatory measures can be extraordinarily important in a industry. If we had a site about making socks, should questions about whether or not is is legal to make socks with material X in the United States be off topic? I would argue no; this could be an important part of sock-making.</p>

<li>I deleted my answer.</li>
<li>I edited it.</li>
<li>There was continued dialogue with the user and another. I improved my answer even further.</li>
<li>Downvote was removed.</li>

<p>I'm grateful to the downvoter, and to the comments. We need to establish what posts are good and bad in the site, and my original answer was not good.
