<li>While people might have opinions on what tool is the best, there are quantifiable ways of demonstrating that some scientific tools are better or worse, which can be important to capture an upvote for future reference.</li>
<li>There are a lot of unknowns in science, and therefore a lot of opinions, so one could argue a lot of things as opinion-based.  Therefore, some leniency should be expected in question asking.</li>

<p>For example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>How to correlate of two zero inflated bedgraph-like signals?</strong></p>
  
  <p>I have iCLIP read counts accross the transcriptome and I wish to know
  if the signals are correlated - that is, where one of them is high, is
  the other likely to be high. </p>
  
  <p>Often when dealing with such data (e.g. iCLIP data) we know that the
  data is generally sparse - that is at most positions both signals are
  zero and this is correct, and also zero-inflated - that is many bases
  that ""should"" have a signal are missing that data. So just calucalting the spearmans correlation is likely to give an artifically low value.</p>
  
  <p>These problems are also present if you want to correlate ChIP-seq
  signals or Mutation frequencies.</p>
  
  <p>What might be a way to address this?</p>

<p><a href=""https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/181241/relationship-between-two-zero-inflated-counts-varying-in-space"">I asked a question similar to this on Cross-validated</a>, but didn't get any response. I feel it might be of more interest to a bioinformatics crowd as it is a problem that seems to come up frequently in bioinformatics. But I wonder if it is too ""stats-y"" for here.</p>

<p>Anyway, my question is: <em>Should I just post questions like this, where I am unsure, and see if people think it is good. Or should I ask for everyone on Meta to see if people think its good?</em></p>

<p>Pro's for asking first:</p>

<ul>
<li>We don't pollute the site with low-quality, closed questions</li>
<li>We build a bank of reasoning why a question would be allowed or not allowed that can be reffered to in the future.</li>

<p>Pro's for just posting:</p>

<ul>
<li>Might lead to a lot of boring repetative questions on meta all basically asking ""Is this allowed? How about this? Not sure about this one?""</li>
<li>Will slow down the accumulation of questions on the site as it will take people time to answer the pre-enquiries before the question is actaully asked.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>What are the pros/cons of computing gene level expression with A vs B?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This approach has a number of benefits:</p>

<ol>
<li>Answers to this question can be more objective. People may still quibble about whether a particular approach is better or worse, but the upsides/downsides of any approach shouldn't generate as much disagreement</li>
<li>This is probably a better way to think about such questions anyway, and answers to such questions are more generalizable to different experiments/approaches. In other words, even if a questioner asks about a particular experimental setup, good answers about the pros/cons of a particular tool will likely apply to other experimental setups.</li>
<li>These answers are less likely to go out of date, since new software will not change the pros/cons of particular approaches, but might change what the best approach is. And even old questions about out of date software will retain value for learners (since they will contain expert thought about how to assess the value of an approach).</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm not sure if this approach is applicable to all questions of this type, but it could certainly be applied to most. It will take more effort from questioners, since they will have to do some research to actually bring up a tool or tools, but this will probably make for better questions anyway, and there's no reason an answer couldn't bring up some new tool that wasn't asked.</p>

3,2,2015-07-14T19:16:18.303,1,,"<p>For both of the main potential audiences of this site, I think we should include the regional dialects.</p>

<p>For native speakers, the regional dialects form a large portion of Arabic as it's spoken today.  For learners, learning at least one dialect is often considered a necessary part of learning the Arabic language (and is pretty important if you actually want to visit a country).</p>

<p>This does mean we should be careful with tagging questions, and it also means we should be open to questions having multiple answers corresponding to different regions.  But the StackExchange format is well-suited to that, and other sites handle the same issue fine.  (For instance, on Academia, many questions have multiple answers with begin by explaining which fields the answer is relevant to.)</p>

<p>One final point: fusha refers to both Classical Arabic and Modern Standard Arabic.  These languages are pretty similar, but there are some usage differences.  So whether or not we include the regional dialects, we should keep in mind that some questions may have multiple answers depending on the language variant (and tag accordingly).</p>

It is called Arabic mainly because of the race, not because of the language itself. </p>

<p>Anyway, same thing is applicable now, the classical Arabic we see now is mainly from Quran and Current Quran is mainly from the Quraish version (one of the seven dialects). In addition to that, each country/region/tribe of Arabs has its own dialect/accent, nothing new here as this was the case throughout history. </p>

5,2,2015-07-14T20:06:44.950,7,,"<p>As I see it, this issue can be broken into two distinct concerns:</p>

<ol>
<li>Should we as a site cater to questions <em>about</em> dialectual variants of Arabic?</li>
<li>Should we as a site encourage posts <em>written</em> in dialectual variants of Arabic?</li>
</ol>

<p>For the first case, I think questions <em>about</em> different dialects should be allowed, for much the same reason Henry mentioned: <a href=""http://meta.arabic.stackexchange.com/a/3/10"">The regional dialects form a large portion of Arabic as it's spoken today</a>. Cutting dialects out of the scope would likely cut out a significant majority of our potential activity.</p>

<p>For the second case, however, I feel that there's value in establishing some clear guidelines to prevent the site from just becoming a mish-mash of dialects. I would suggest the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Consider English and Fusha as the ""official"" languages of this site</p>

<ul>
<li>Assuming that the majority of our users can (a) understand Fusha, and (b) understand English, seems to be a reasonable compromise (short of just abandoning English-language entirely, which given most of the posts on the site so far (including this meta) are written in English is probably going to be a hard sell)</li>
<li>Using regional dialects in meta discussions should be expressly discouraged; community opinion can only truly be gauged if the bulk of the community can reasonably <em>understand</em> what is being discussed, and many Arabic dialects are not mutually understandable. </li>
<li>Meta posts, policy discussions, FAQs with any sort of ""official"" weight <em>must</em> be written in one or the other (ideally both).

<ul>
<li>Any meta posts which the Stack Exchange community team (rather than just the site community/moderators) may need to be aware of must be written in English, as few if any of them are fluent in Arabic. In particular, this would include things like bug reports and feature requests.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Allow questions on the main page in regional dialects, but only if they're expressly <em>about</em> some aspect of that dialect, and <em>tagged appropriately</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Users should be allowed to ask questions in the manner which is most comfortable to them when possible; using their own dialect seems safe, so long as any possible answer would be relevant to that dialect</li>
<li>It is reasonable to assume that any experts capable of answering a question <em>about</em> a particular dialect is also <em>fluent</em> in that particular dialect. Conversely, it is reasonable to assume that any experts <em>not</em> fluent in that particular dialect are poorly qualified to answer questions <em>about</em> that particular dialect.</li>
<li>This allows users fluent/not-fluent in particular dialects to selectively ignore/highlight/select questions that they can actually understand based on tags.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Insist that answers on the main page only use dialect if the question is written in that dialect.

<ul>
<li>English questions should get English answers, and Arabic questions should get Arabic answers.</li>
<li>Even if a question is tagged with a dialect, if it's asked in (a) Fusha, or (b) English, so must the answer be written</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>In short, the only time a dialect should be used is if it&hellip;</p>

<ol>
<li>&hellip;is a question about and tagged with that particular dialect, or</li>
<li>&hellip;is an answer posted to a question using that dialect.</li>
</ol>

<p>Otherwise, either Fusha or English should be used.  From my understanding (I am hardly an Arabic native) Fusha is rather universally <em>understood</em> among Arabic speakers, even when it's rarely if ever actually <em>spoken</em>. So establishing it as the <em>lingua franca</em> of Arabic here makes sense to me.</p>

<p>Many users of the proposal signed up specifically for the questions about the dialects of the language as such we need to come up with a plan to support this otherwise we will drive people away.</p>

<p>As such this is not a question of ""if"" but ""how"".</p>

<p>On the proposal we hinted that classical (Fusha) Arabic was the default dialect of all questions/answers and I see no reason to change that.</p>

<p>However, the big question, of which some of these answers try to solve, is how to deal with dialects when they do arise.</p>

<p>Having read @GoldPseudo's answer it seems he knows what he is on about and his ideas seem sound. </p>

<p>It makes sense that if someone asks in English it is likely that they are a student or learner of Arabic, as such the answers should probably be English as well.

<p>We should probably encourage this stance and punish those who do not follow it with downvotes to try and create some norm, else I can see this quickly becoming a mess.</p>

<p>We should also allocate tags for dialects as suggested. We need to be more careful about this last point though and I am still unclear exactly how we should structure this. It might come down to just seeing what actual users do and then cleaning their process up into something workable.</p>

9,2,2017-08-02T19:49:14.807,4,,"<p>The final fallback for market resolution (after all reporters have reported on an event and someone still believes the answer is wrong) is called Fork Resolution.  Only one fork can be active at a time per branch (in Augur, a branch is akin to an entire universe that is isolated from other universes).  Once a fork starts, all other markets that are awaiting reporter based resolution (this does not include automated reporting) are delayed until the fork resolves.  Once the fork resolves, all of those pending markets will migrate to the branch (universe) that won the fork.</p>

<p>The fact that existing markets migrate to a particular world view is one of the first differences with AgnosticPM.  In AgnosticPM, the universe a market lives in is based entirely on markets that came before.  In Augur, while a market is created within a particular universe (branch), it will migrate forward to another branch if a fork occurs before the market settles.  The reason for this is because if a fork occurs, we must assume that reporters have been compromised and any reporting they do is invalid.  It is also assumed that the fork resolution process is the best answer we have to ""who was right"".</p>

<p>As for how the fork resolution process actually works, its pretty simple.  Before the fork, there is REP (tokens) that is associated with a particular branch (universe).  This REP is traded on exchanges and has some market value.  When a fork occurs, a new branch is created (conceptually) for every possible outcome and each branch has a new REP token.  Anyone who holds the original REP token can convert (1:1 ratio) their token to a REP token on <em>any</em> branch of the fork.  The act of converting your REP from the parent branch to a child is how you vote for which branch you think represents reality.  Once you have cast your vote, there is no going back so be certain!</p>

<p>At the end of the fork (currently ~2 months) whichever branch had the most REP migrated to it is considered the winner and all existing markets needing reporting will migrate to that branch, and share tokens for the forking market will be redeemed using the outcome from that branch.</p>

<p>This begs the question, why would I risk my REP casting a vote instead of just keeping my original REP?  The answer to this is that no new markets can be created on the original branch and all existing markets will resolve on the winning branch.  This means that REP on the original branch will yield no reporting fees to REP holders as there will be no markets to report on.  As a REP holder, your job is to pick the branch that you think the most future fees will come from.  This means you want to pick the branch that has the most market participation (volume/outstanding interest) so your REP gets the maximum amount of fees long term.  In almost all cases, this will be the branch that represents the truth/reality.  The only cases where this is less certain are forks that are highly contentious, where not everyone agrees on what reality even means.</p>

<p>In order to incentivize people to migrate their REP during the voting period (tentatively 2 months), there will likely be some small inflation assigned to everyone who migrates sooner rather than later (e.g., 5%).  The idea here is that if you pick a side (rather than abstaining) then your share of REP will <em>not</em> be diluted.  If you abstain, then your share of REP will be diluted by some amount relative to how many people migrate.  The goal here is to make it so abstaining from the vote is a losing strategy in almost all cases (non-contentious forks) as this increases the cost of mounting a forking attack against Augur.</p>

<p>Regarding AgnosticPM, Augur is <em>similar</em> in that it has a concept of branches (universes) which have a history of truths associated with them.  The primary difference between Augur and AgnosticPM is that Augur has a concept of finality, meaning that the system has the ability to assert that a particular outcome is an absolute truth for the sake of paying out winnings.  In AgnosticPM, there is no way to extract deposited ETH from the system, its ETH-in-only.  This is a pretty huge difference as it means that AgnosticPM, while fun and possibly effective, doesn't have a way of liquidating its ETH holdings back to participants to payout.  As long as AgnosticPM experiences heavy growth, this may not be a problem but if it ever ceases to experience usage growth then this becomes a big problem.  Investors know this, which will likely make them hesitant to buy any AgnosticPM share tokens, which is likely to drive their value to below 1 ETH (their target).</p>

<p>I was wondering how can I help the site at this early stage. I thought about asking about how to get started with 3D printing but SE explicitly discourages ""easy"" questions in the private beta.</p>

<p>What can newbies like me do for the site at this stage besides voting questions and answers?</p>

2,1,2016-01-12T19:39:07.193,2,46,"<p>There are many different printing technologies. While it might be clear to the asker that he's talking about his home 3D printing machine, that's not necessarily the case for those that try to answer the question.</p>

<p>I think it would help to specify the scope of questions with tags, to allow future visitors to identify what type of 3D printer it is about. Answers to a lot of questions related to general properties of the printing process like printing speed, resolution, additional manual work, support structures, etc. depend heavily on the technology that's being used.</p>

<p>This also prevents ""Well, it depends..."" type of answers that cover a lot of possibly unrelated things.</p>

<p>If you look at Stack Overflow, for example, all questions must be tagged with the language the OP is asking about. I doubt there will be many questions that are asking about all technologies at once - and if they are, that's likely to be marked as too broad anyway.</p>

<hr>

<h2>What should our documentation contain?</h2>

<p>Much of the sites documentation will be the same as on every other Stack Exchange site: “be nice,” “how to create an account,” “how to ask questions” — it’s all pretty static. Even the sections about “what kind of questions should I (not) ask here?” comes primarily from <a href=""http://area51.stackexchange.com/faq#questions"">the Definition phase of Area 51</a>.</p>

<p>But the questions you want to discuss in meta are those issues specific to your site that need to be mentioned in the Help Center.</p>

<p>Take the <a href=""https://superuser.com/faq"">Super User ""About"" page</a> as an example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Super User is for computer enthusiasts and power users.</p>
  
  <p>Ask about...</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Specific issues with computer software, hardware or networking</li>
  <li>Real problems or questions that you’ve encountered</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Don't ask about...</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Anything not directly related to computer software or computer hardware</li>
  <li>Questions that are primarily opinion-based</li>
  <li>Questions with too many possible answers or require an extremely long answer</li>
  <li>Videogames, consoles, or other electronic devices, unless they connect to your computer</li>
  <li>Websites or web services like Google, Facebook, Twitter, and WordPress</li>
  <li>Shopping, buying or product recommendations</li>
  <li>Issues specific to corporate IT support and networks</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>These are then elaborated on in SU's <a href=""https://superuser.com/help/on-topic"">What topics can I ask about here?</a> page.</p>

<p>It took almost a year to figure out the list of “we want these sort of questions” and “we don’t want these sort of questions” on Super User. Area 51 gave you a head start but you should also be working out other FAQ-related issues <strong>specific to your topic and your community</strong>.</p>

11,1,2016-01-12T20:52:02.930,10,281,"<p>Given our successful private beta, soon after we go public it will be time for us to get our first crop of moderators, as explained in the <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/moderator-pro-tempore/"">“Moderator Pro Tempore” blog post</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>About a week into the public beta, we will seek out members who are deeply engaged in the community’s development; members who:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Have a reasonably high reputation score to indicate active, consistent participation.</li>
  <li>Show an interest in their meta’s community-building activities.</li>
  <li>Lead by example, showing patience and respect for their fellow community members in everything they write.</li>
  <li>Exhibit those intangible traits discussed in <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/""><em>A Theory of Moderation</em></a>.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Bonus points for:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Members with participation in both meta and the parent site (i.e. interest in both community building and expertise in the field).</li>
  <li>Area 51 participation, social network referrals, or blogging about the site.</li>
  <li>Members who have already shown an interest or ability to promote their community.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Candidates will be contacted and three of them will be selected to act as provisional Moderators until the community holds formal elections after the Beta period. Besides the normal abilities of a Moderator, they will:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Have access to a special chat room where we will collectively work through the challenges of moderation and community self-policing.</li>
  <li>Organize the process of selecting the site's attributes (domain names, design issues, the FAQ, etc.).</li>
  <li>Rally community support and drive the mission of getting publicity for the site.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Essentially, <strong>they will have the ear of the Stack Exchange team for anything we can do to help their sites succeed!</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although the moderators pro tempore will ultimately be selected by Stack Exchange, the purpose of this post is to seek out and propose candidates:</p>

<ul>
<li>Each nomination should be posted as an answer and it should include (at minimum) a link to the user's main and meta profile so we can check out their activity.</li>
<li>Self nominations are encouraged, step up if you feel you can help.</li>
<li>If you are nominated by someone else you should edit the answer and let us know if you accept or decline (explanation optional). If a nominee declines we will not delete the answer, as to not have someone else nominate them again.</li>
<li>If you are nominating someone else, please mark the post as Community Wiki before saving. Meta doesn't allow suggested edits, so your nominee may be blocked from accepting the nomination.</li>
<li>The nominations are not binding to Stack Exchange or the nominees. If you are being considered by Stack Exchange, you will get an official confirmation email at one point. </li>
<li>Before nominating someone or accept / decline a nomination, you should read <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/""><em>A Theory of Moderation</em></a> thoroughly to find out what's generally expected from moderators.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you would like to learn more about the role, please drop into <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/34216/3d-printing"">chat room</a> where you can ask about the role from other moderators (they appear with a blue name in the chat room). Another chatroom called <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/2691/the-assembly"">The Assembly</a> was created specifically for users and moderators to discuss moderation activities, moderators from all over the network are there to answer your questions.</p>

<p>Once again, <strong>please don't hesitate to step up and self-nominate!</strong>. </p>
